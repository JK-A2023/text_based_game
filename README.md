# TEXT-BASED-GAME

## How to play:

1. Character Creation:
   1. Pick your race.
   2. Pick your class.
   3. Pick your name.
   4. Confirm character.
   5. At any point if you wish to change during the character creation process, confirm no (n), and you may reselect.


2. First round:
   1. The first round is decided by a dice roll.
   2. If it is greater than 3, you are awarded the first round.
   3. Else, the CPU will go first.


3. Map / Movement:
   1. Currently, you can only fight while next to the CPU on either side (although I will add the ability to fight if they're directly above or below you shortly).
   2. Move up, down, left, or right, one tile at a time, until you are next to the CPU (marked with a C).
   3. If you try to attack before this, you will not be in range.
   4. The CPU in turn will try to close the distance to you.
